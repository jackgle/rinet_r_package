\title{Predict statistics of the underlying reference distribution from mixture distributions using RINet}
\usage{
predict_rinet(
  data,
  feature_grid_range = c(-4, 4),
  feature_grid_nbins = 100,
  verbose = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector, matrix, or list. For 1D: vector or matrix with
1 column. For 2D: matrix with 2 columns. Can also be a list of such objects.}

\item{feature_grid_range}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the range
for histogram binning. Default is c(-4, 4).}

\item{feature_grid_nbins}{Integer specifying the number of histogram bins.
Default is 100.}

\item{verbose}{Integer controlling verbosity (0 = silent). Default is 0.}
}
\value{
A list of predictions. Each element contains:
  \item{mean}{Predicted mean(s)}
  \item{std}{Predicted standard deviation(s)}
  \item{covariance}{Predicted covariance matrix}
  \item{correlation}{Predicted correlation (NA for 1D)}
  \item{reference_fraction}{Predicted reference component fraction}
}
\description{
Automatically detects whether input data is 1D or 2D and calls the
appropriate prediction function. This is the main user-facing function.
It estimates the statistics of a "healthy" reference population from a
mixture of healthy and pathological measurements.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # 1D sample
  sample_1d <- rnorm(1000)
  result <- predict_rinet(sample_1d)
  
  # 2D sample
  sample_2d <- matrix(rnorm(2000), ncol = 2)
  result <- predict_rinet(sample_2d)
  
  # Multiple samples (automatically detected)
  samples <- list(rnorm(1000), rnorm(1000))
  results <- predict_rinet(samples)
}
